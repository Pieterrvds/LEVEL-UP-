      <p><strong>My Goal:</strong></p>
      I believe in not just physical workouts but also mental conditioning, flexibility, and proper nutrition!
      No matter where you start, we can work together to unlock your full potential and achieve long-term success.
      My goal is to empower you and make fitness a fun and sustainable part of your lifestyle!
    </p>
<p>
  <p><strong>Why fitness coach?:</strong></p>    
      I love to motivate people in every way when i enjoy workingout with others and have a fun time while doing it. 
      At the end of the day we all just want a happier lifestyle and ever lasting memories and it all starts with a healthier body and mind! 
</p>
<p>
  <p><strong>What about my logo?:</strong></p>   
      From the time i was old enough to start fitness my father put a pull-up bar in the middle of my room and told me he could do 20 pull-ups 
      at a time when he was in his prime time. This is something i looked up too and i wanted to prove to him i could do even more. 
      So thats when i started doing pull-ups almost every day. I made a ritual out of it, waking up in the morning 10 pull ups, before going to sleep: 10pullups
      In between my studies, 10 pull-ups. When i was not in the mood to do pull-ups: 10 pull-ups. Years passed by and i started to be very good at it. 
      I realized that staying consistent at something and staying committed really was the key to achieving anything, meaniwhile enjoying the process!!!
      I began teaching other people the basics of a pull-up and begin to study for my personal coach cerificate, i took it a step further and started coaching a group of people 
      my type of training. To start proffesional i had to come with a logo and name and that was pretty easy for me, it needed to be simple, short and easy to understand. 
      thats how i came up with the namen <strong>LEVEL-UP crossfit</strong> with a pull-up symbol!
