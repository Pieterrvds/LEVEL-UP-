      <p><strong>About Me:</strong></p>
      Fisrt of all Welcome to my website! This website is programmed by myself, and it took time and determination but i enjoyed the process of making it, and i hope you like the simplicity of it!
      To start about me, i graduated as an Industrial Chemical Engineer with a Masters in Polymer-Processing.
      You'll probably ask youreself why are you starting this organization when you can focus on you're carreer as engineer instead?
      I'ts simple actually. I just love working out too much! And who doesn't?! I'm excited to share with you my passion for fitness and wellness. I

    <p>
      <p><strong>Why fitness coach?:</strong></p>    
      I became a fitness coach because I love inspiring and motivating people while sharing the joy of working out together. 
      Fitness isn't just about physical activity; it's about creating a fun, supportive environment where everyone can thrive. 
      At the end of the day, we all strive for a happier, more fulfilling lifestyle filled with lasting memories—and that journey begins with building a healthier body and mind! 
    </p>
    <p>
    <p><strong>What about my logo?:</strong></p>   
      From the time I was old enough to start focusing on fitness, my father installed a pull-up bar in the middle of my room. He proudly told me that in his prime, he could do 20 pull-ups in one go. I admired his achievement and became determined to surpass it.
      That's when my journey began. I made it a daily ritual: 10 pull-ups in the morning, 10 pull-ups before bed, and 10 pull-ups in between my study sessions. Even on days when I didn't feel like doing them, I pushed myself to complete 10 pull-ups.
      Over the years, my persistence paid off, and I became highly skilled at pull-ups. This experience taught me a powerful lesson: consistency and commitment are the keys to achieving anything. Even more importantly, I learned to enjoy the process.
      Inspired by my progress, I started teaching others the basics of pull-ups. My passion grew, and I decided to pursue a personal coaching certification. Taking it a step further, I began coaching a group of people using my unique training approach.
      To make things official, I needed a logo and name for my professional venture. The choice was simple—I wanted something short, clear, and easy to remember.
      Thats how i came up with the name <strong>LEVEL-UP crossfit</strong> featuring a pull-up symbol to represent the core of my journey and philosophy!
